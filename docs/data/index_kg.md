## How To Add Your KG

To contribute your Knowledge Graph datasets, please refer to the [Model Submission Guide](loading_model.md). Ensure that your dataset is in a supported format (e.g., RDF, TTL, or CSV triples) and passes validation checks. Once approved, your dataset will be automatically listed in this table and integrated into the evaluation pipeline.
