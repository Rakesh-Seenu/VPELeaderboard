# Adding New Models to the Repository

This guide explains how to upload and contribute a new model to the repository. Please ensure that all required files are correctly named and placed in the appropriate directories before submitting.

---

## Required Files

To submit a model, **you must provide both of the following**:

- **XML Model File**

  Example: `BIOMD000000064.xml`  
  ‚û§ Place this in the `models/` directory.

- **YAML Configuration File**

  Example: `BIOMD000000064_url.yaml`  
  ‚û§ Place this in the `configs/` directory.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your model will **not be accepted** if either the XML or YAML file is missing.

---

## üóÇ Folder Structure Reference

Your files should be organized as follows:

```
vpeleaderboard/data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BIOMD000000064.xml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ configs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ BIOMD000000064_url.yaml
```

- Both files must share the **same base name** (e.g., `BIOMD000000064`).
- The YAML filename must end with `.yaml`.
