## Getting Started with VPELeaderboard

Welcome to **VPELeaderboard**, an open-source project developed by **Team VPE**. The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and benchmark the performance of advanced time series forecasting models when applied to simulated biological data. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted mathematical models, we focus on directly forecasting simulation results through AI-driven techniques. This leaderboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of these models, offering valuable insights into their effectiveness in predicting the dynamics of complex biological systems.

Our toolkit currently consists of the following components:

- **Data:** Explore integrated datasets, including ordinary differential equation models in SBML format.
- **Algorithms:** A collection of cutting-edge algorithms that have been developed to tackle time series forecasting and predictive modeling tasks.
- **Leaderboard:** An interactive leaderboard that evaluates and compares the performance of time series forecasting models, focusing on how well they predict the trajectories of simulated biological processes.
