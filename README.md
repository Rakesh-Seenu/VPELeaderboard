<h1 align="center" style="border-bottom: none;">ðŸš€ Template to write source code for ML and data models</h1>

## How to use this repo?
1. Click on the `Use this template` button on the top-right of the page to create a copy of this repo.
2. Update the `setup` method in `setup.py`, and change the `package_name` in `release.config.js`.
3. Place your configs in `configs/*`, ML and data models in `app/*`, their corresponding tests in `tests/*`, and test notebooks in `experiment/*` (check out our Code/Dev/Data/MLOps guides for more information).
*Please note that all the protocols defined for Code/DevOps (e.g.: how to test your code locally, install pylint in VScode, define virtualenv, etc.) are also applicable to this template.*
4. Define the layout of your code documentaton website in `mkdocs.yml` and the web pages in `docs/*` in the markdown format (view the documentation of the example code used in the repo [here](https://virtualpatientengine.github.io/demoMLsourceCode))
5. Check out the layout below for more information.
